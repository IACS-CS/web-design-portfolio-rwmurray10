<h1> 8th grade</h1>
	<p>
    In eith grade I was one of the best players oun the team and starting striker. I scored 11 goals in 10 matches including 2 hat tricks a day apart. My performences were at a career best and I was so happy to socre my first and then second career hat trick. I was the second top socrer and named an all star on my team. We did not have the best season going out 7-6 in the semi finals at home to a team we had beat 7-5 only a few days earlier. I was heartbroken to lose my last game for my school and not to at least be in the final as I wanted to end my middle school career with a Playoff win.
