<h1> Freshman year</h1>
	<p>
    For my freshman year I was at a new school. I was brand new and one f the youngest players on the team. I still was on varsity as a backup striker. I regularly came of the bench in games and even started a few. I wished I could play more games but I had to accept I was not going to be better than the seniors who started. I scored one goal during my freshman year which was very frustrating and I was determined to play much more and score more goals the next year.
