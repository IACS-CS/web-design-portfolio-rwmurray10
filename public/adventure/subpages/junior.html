<h1> JUNIOR YEAR</h1>
	<p>
    In my junior year I was one of the best players on the team and a key player. I played as a right winger or midfielder. I scored four goalsand one assit and was involved in many other goals and was a regular starter. We had a rocky season as our coach quit halfway through the season. Our new coach improved the team morale and changed the style of play. We imporved a lot and won a few games and did not get beaten as heavliy before. I was mostly happy with my performances and could not wait for senior year as I was nominated to be one of the Captains.I hope to have an even better senior year.
