<h1> SOPHMORE YEAR</h1>
	<p>
   In my sophmore year I was one of the better players on the team and a regular starter. I had to play as a right midfielder most the time because one of the seniors was our best player and top scorer. I scored 5 goals 2 for the varisty team and played well as we won a few games and had a much better season than my freshman year.
