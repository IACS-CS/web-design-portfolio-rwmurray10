<h1> 5th and 6th grade</h1>
	<p>
    In 5th grade I was very excited to play for my schools soccer team. I was very dissapionted to be cut from the team. I worked very hard over the next year to make sure I would make the team. I made the team in sixth grade but was one of the worst players on the team. I only started a few games and regularly had to come on as a sub. My team was brillant though as we won the playoffs 4-0 in the final and were ubeated all season only drawing one game. I scored once in a 9-0 win in the playoffs and my teamates were just as happy as me when I scored.
