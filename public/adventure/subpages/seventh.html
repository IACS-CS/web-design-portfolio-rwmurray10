<h1> 7th grade</h1>
	<p>
    In sevnth grade I again made the team and was a regular starter. I played much better than I did in sith grade and scored 2 goals. My team did not go unbeaten but we won most of our games. In the playoffs we dramaticly won the semi finals on penalties after a 3-3 draw where we had to come from behind. In the final I started as a left winger and we wer 2-0 up at half time. In the second half it went all wrong and we let in 5 goals and lost 2-5. I was very dissapionted and was determined to do better next year induvidually and as a team.
