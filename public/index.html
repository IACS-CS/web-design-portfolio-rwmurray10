            <h1>About ME</h1>
            <p>My name is Ryan Murray. I am currently a Senior at Innovation Academy Charter School (IACS). 
              My passion is soccer, and I played on the Varisty soccer team for all 4 years. 
              My Senior year I was elected as one of the Captains on the team. 
              After I graduate from IACS in June, I plan to attend college where I hope to merge my passion for soccer and soccer statistics into a gainful career within sports media.</p>

              <br><p>One of my favorite soccer plays is to take corner kicks for the team. Below is a video of me taking a corner kick during our Senior night game against Lowell Catholic High School.</p></br>

              <br><p>Although this corner kick did not result in a goal, we did win the game 1-0 when I scored a goal during the first half.</p></br>

            <p>The pictures above show me scoring the goal, and then celebrating afterwards with my teammate Daniel. I'm #26.</p>

        <p>
          This was my first project during this semester for Web Design.
          I chose to give a history of my soccer career since I started playing at age 6.

          Zen Garden was a project asking to introduce CSS to this Web Design class.
          HTML was given to us, and we needed to change the looks of the webpage using CSS to make it more personalized and a more beautiful design.

          This Imitation Project was to show the creativity of using CSS to imitate the design of a Fruit Loops box.
